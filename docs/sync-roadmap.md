# Fork Sync Roadmap — sync/upstream-2026q2

Generated 2026-05-18. Synthesizes 4 expert simulations (Scott Chacon, Junio C Hamano, Martin Fowler, Greg Kroah-Hartman) into a concrete plan for integrating `Beingpax/VoiceInk` upstream into `lis186/VoiceInk` fork.

## TL;DR

- **`main`** = old fork HEAD (29d247a) — preserved, untouched
- **`sync/upstream-2026q2`** = upstream HEAD + 1 cherry-picked commit (`feat: add make share target`)
- **`backup/pre-sync-20260518-225119`** = pre-sync safety state with original dirty files

Upstream did a god-object refactor (PR #563: decompose `WhisperState`, rename `VoiceInk/Whisper/` → `VoiceInk/Transcription/Whisper/`). The fork's 32 commits land in three categories: 5 clean, 17 modify/delete, 10 content-conflict.

## Strategy (Fowler + Greg KH consensus)

Stop trying to merge 200 commits in one shot. Reset to upstream tip, then port fork features forward in priority order — simplest first, architecturally entangled last. Open PRs to Beingpax for the orthogonal wins (memory leaks, build tooling, zh-TW) so they stop being your maintenance burden.

## Per-Commit Triage

| Verdict | Meaning | Count |
|---------|---------|-------|
| CLEAN | Cherry-picks without conflict | 5 |
| MODIFY-DELETE | Targets file upstream deleted; needs re-implementation | 17 |
| CONTENT-CONFLICT | Both sides modified; needs semantic merge | 10 |

Full triage table: `/tmp/fork-triage.tsv` (regenerable from fork-commits.txt).

## Priority Order

### Priority 1 — Open PRs to upstream (Greg KH's advice)
These are obvious upstream-friendly fixes; getting them merged removes them from your fork forever.

- **Build tooling** — `64d64eb feat: add make share target` (already applied to sync branch; ready to open PR)
- **Memory leak fixes (CLEAN parts)** — `1912ea1 Merge fix/memory-leaks` itself, plus the orthogonal pieces. The deleted-target pieces need to land as new patches against the decomposed classes.
- **Audio fix** — `cfa2fc0 fix: replace AudioObjectPropertyListener with ListenerBlock API` (content conflict — likely small manual merge in `AudioDeviceManager.swift`)
- **zh-TW localization** — 4 commits; need to land against new `VoiceInk/Transcription/Whisper/WhisperPrompt.swift` path. Open as a single feature PR upstream.

### Priority 2 — Manual conflict resolution (your fork only)
These need domain judgment but can stay on the fork.

- **`3e15e97 Fix input source history corruption during paste`** — Both sides rewrote paste logic in `CursorPaster.swift`. Compare:
  - Fork's approach: input-source-switching for QWERTY-on-command keyboards
  - Upstream's approach: AppleScript fallback for non-QWERTY (commit `dededd4 Fix AppleScript paste for QWERTY-on-command keyboard layouts`)
  - These solve overlapping problems differently. Pick one or merge both ideas.
- **`720f0a8 OSLog privacy annotation`** — Depends on `6f5eda6` adding `Logger.memoryUsage` extension; cherry-pick must follow that.

### Priority 3 — Re-implement Qwen3 on new architecture (the hard part)
Upstream's `decompose WhisperState god object` refactor (PR #563, commit `4c98b44`) split `WhisperState.swift` into multiple single-responsibility classes. Your 12 Qwen3 commits extend the deleted god-object.

**Required reading before re-implementation**:
1. PR #563 — `git log --oneline 4c98b44^..4c98b44 -- VoiceInk/`
2. New transcription provider architecture:
   - `VoiceInk/Transcription/Engine/TranscriptionServiceRegistry.swift`
   - `VoiceInk/Transcription/Whisper/WhisperModelManager.swift`
   - `VoiceInk/Transcription/Whisper/LibWhisper.swift`
3. Upstream's FluidAudio integration: `5722a32`, `04cef98` (FluidAudio rename from Parakeet)

**Per Martin Fowler**: Define one `TranscriptionProvider` abstraction inside the refactored tree. Port Qwen3 as one implementation (`Qwen3FluidAudioProvider`, `Qwen3MLXProvider`); the existing FluidAudio integration is your prior art.

**Re-implementation order**:
1. `5bf5c0e` — add `Qwen3Model` enum + `qwen3FluidAudio/qwen3MLX` ModelProvider cases → adapt to upstream's `TranscriptionModel`
2. `16434a7` — register Qwen3-ASR models in PredefinedModels → upstream renamed/moved this
3. `5198ada` + `bae0189` — Qwen3FluidAudio/MLX services (these triaged CLEAN — apply first, then wire into new registry)
4. `2e2e2fa` — route Qwen3 in TranscriptionServiceRegistry → wire against new registry shape
5. `ce34499` + `4ac52d9` — Qwen3 download helpers → port to new model-manager separation
6. UI commits (`0217fb1`, `1c2fa71`) — adapt to upstream's ModelCardView changes

### Priority 4 — Skip
- `f4163737 Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/main'` — old merge; superseded by this sync
- `1912ea1 Merge fix/memory-leaks` — merge commit; cherry-pick children instead
- `bb8dc0e fix: exclude Index.noindex from DerivedData` — upstream's `LOCAL_DERIVED_DATA` path approach (`1e1896d`) supersedes the find-based exclusion

## Concrete Next Actions

1. **Today (~30 min)**: Push `sync/upstream-2026q2` to GitHub as a feature branch. Verify Xcode opens it and builds (will fail until Qwen3 ports land — that's expected).
2. **This week (~2-4 hours)**: Read upstream's PR #563 + FluidAudio integration. Sketch the new `TranscriptionProvider` shape that fits both Whisper, FluidAudio, and Qwen3.
3. **Next week**: Open upstream PRs for memory-leak fixes (separate small PRs, one per fix). Greg KH's rule: every commit upstreamed is one less to maintain.
4. **Sprint after**: Port Qwen3 stack onto new architecture. The two CLEAN Qwen3 service files (`5198ada`, `bae0189`) are your starting point — they're new files that don't conflict, but reference deleted classes; rewriting those references is the work.
5. **Then**: Open upstream PR for zh-TW localization as a single feature contribution.

## Rollback

```bash
git switch main
git branch -D sync/upstream-2026q2    # discard integration branch
git reset --hard backup/pre-sync-20260518-225119   # restore original dirty state
```
